# JSONTestApp
A test iOS/Swfit App that loads JSON data into a UITableView, and also loads a URL into a UIWebView detail view.

Initial code comes from a tutorial at http://www.learnswift.io/

Added the functionality as recommended in the last part of the tutorial to load the url in a webview for each repository as an additional "challenge".

May add a search bar for the repos as well if I have time.
